#wordle_python_basic
I tried to recreate the "Wordle" game in this project.
It is not exactly like "Wordle" but it follows the same fundamentals of the game.
I have only used python basics to create this project.
I have added 3 difficulty levels.
I am planning to add a scoring system to the game.
Also the word library is limited and I will improve it soon.
Have fun with the code.
